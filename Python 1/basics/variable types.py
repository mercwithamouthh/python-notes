#--String is a text value can use "" or ''
name = "caleb"
name = 'caleb'

#--Integers (shortened with int) is a number value, no quotation marks are needed (there are 2 other ways to declare numbers, will go over later)

age = 16

#--Boolean is a true or false statement (assigning a vaule to be true or false obviously), first letter of both MUST be capitalized

example2 = False

#--Printing Data Types

number = 21
number2 = "21"

print(number)
print(number2) 
#these will both print the same, however one is an interger and one is a string which is important to keep in mind. they are not the same

example3 = True
example4 = "True"

print(example3)
print(example4)
#same exact thing as before, just another example
