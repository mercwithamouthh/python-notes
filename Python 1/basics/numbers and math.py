#even though these represent the name number they are not the same, one is an int and the other is a float

#--Math, this is insanely boring but python can be used for math, uses PEMDAS and + - * /

spiders = 10
legs = 8
total= spiders * legs
print(total) #output is obviously 80

print(spiders * legs)
print(spiders + 25)
#alt version of doing the same thing as before but can preform arithmetic inside of the print statement

#--Divison will always give you a float data type instead of a int
bees = 16
flowers = 2
print(bees / flowers)

#--Modulus stand for % which will return the remainder if a number was divided

fruits = 29 % 5
print(fruits)
#answer is 5 with a remainder of 4, but this will only print out 4

#can determine if a number is even or odd (remainder 0 = even remainder 1 = odd) if you are too stupid to figure it out yourself
