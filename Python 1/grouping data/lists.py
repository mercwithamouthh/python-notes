#there are 3 ways to group data together (list, dictionary, tuple), however this will only be going over lists

#Lists a data group that is ordered (numbered) and changeable (you can change the list items).  Allows duplicates.

#--Creating Lists

lomls = ["batman", "wolverine", "batman again" , "wolverine again", "tom"]
print(lomls)
#lists are assigned to a variable, they can also contain other data types

numbers = [1, 2, 3,4 ]
print(numbers)

#lists can also have a combination of both
combination = ["batman", 1, "wolverine", 1]
print(combination)
